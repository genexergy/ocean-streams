## About Ocean Streams

Ocean Streams in an [OpenSensorHub](http://www.opensensorhub.org) powered project for maritime and oceanographic systems and
platforms employing Open Geospatial Consortium's globally recognized Connected Systems standard enabling collecting,
recording, and processing sensor observations and tasking.

### Repositories

https://github.com/nickgaray/ocean-streams.git

#### Requirements

This project requires Java 17 or higher.

For quick download and installation: [OpenLogic OpenJDK Downloads](https://www.openlogic.com/openjdk-downloads)

#### Synopsis

The current “node” source code of OpenSensorHub is located at GitHub. The repositories contain the source code necessary
to build a new OSH node, driver, processes, and libraries, but they also make use of the OpenSensorHub open source core
and addons. These open source technologies are referred to by the respective repositories they are employed in as "
submodules." Therefore, it is important to note that when using git commands to “checkout” any one of these
repositories, you do so with the following command:

         git clone -–recursive https://github.com/nickgaray/ocean-streams.git

## Building and Deploying the Node

### Gradle

Building the Node with Jetty deployable web server from the command line is as simple as checking the repository out and
building with a simple command

         git clone --recursive https://github.com/nickgaray/ocean-streams.git
         cd ocean-streams
         ./gradlew build -x test

The resulting build will be contained in /ocean-streams/build/distributions/osh-node-*.*.*.zip

Deploying is as simple as copying the zip file to the target destination and unzipping the file. You can then run
./launch.sh in Linux or ./launch.bat in Windows environment to startup OpenSensorHub.

#### Default OSH Configuration

With the deployment package, there is a ***config.json*** file containing a default configuration of
OpenSensorHub. Within this configuration, only default users and services are configured.
The default administrative credentials are

    uname: admin
    password: admin

The default port is

    port: 8080

The default URL to access the admin panel is:

    https://<address>/sensorhub/admin

where **address** is the URL or IP address of the system hosting OpenSensorHub

## Viewing Log Files

The general log file is accessible through the external volumes at

    .moduledata/log.txt

Log files for drivers, services, etc. are accessible through

    /home/osh/osh_config/.moduledata

For a specific module, the log files are contained within subdirectory given the module's unique identifier
